# N-Body Simulator for Galaxies
---
Generates a galaxy and simulates its movement using an N-body sim that utilises the Barnes-Hut algorithm. Currently only generates a galaxy using parameters from Andromeda.

Python acts as a backend, generating a .csv file of positions that the frontend can read to visualise the sim using the HTML canvas element.
